In most cases it is not necessary to build the multiuser docker image
yourself, and instead it is recommended to use the pre-built multiuser
image from the cyberhubs docker hub repository. Check the
./docker-compose.yml file where the option to build the images
yourself or to pull the multiuser image from the docker hub are
clearly indicated. Uncomment the desired option. Again, the default is
to pull the image from docker hub, and this option is recommended.

Building manually:
------------------
If you decide to build yourself the docker-compose mechanism will launch the 
build command automatically if the image does not yet exist. If you need to 
build manually, use 
  docker-compose build

Launching cyberlab:
-------------------
Before launching, ensure that multiuser/SSL/ contains the necessary 
certificates in that directory. See README in multiuser/SSL/README
for instructions on how to get said keys.

Create local network for jupyter instances (if you have to
docker-compose down and up you do not to redo the network create
step):

 docker network create jupyterhub-network
    
To start server run command:

 docker-compose up

If you do not wish to see debugging information, and wish to run up
docker in the background use:

 docker-compose up -d

Stoping and cleaning up:
------------------------
To stop the server run command:

 docker-compose down

Kill and remove all docker container:

 docker kill $(docker ps -aq)
 docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Or all together:

 docker-compose down; docker kill $(docker ps -aq); docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Remove docker images: 

 docker rmi $(docker images -q)
