In most cases it is not necessary to build the multiuser docker image
yourself, and instead it is recommended to use the pre-built multiuser
image from the cyberhubs docker hub repository. In that case skip the
build step.  

To build the image, you must first see ./docker-compose.yml and see the
commented lines. There are four lines necessary to uncomment, and one
line that will need to be commented.

Building multiuser image:
-------------------------
(Not recommended) If for some reason you do want to build the
dockerfile yourself run command:

 docker-compose build

Launching cyberlab:
-------------------
Before launching, ensure that multiuser/SSL/ contains the necessary 
certificates in that directory. See README in multiuser/SSL/README
for instructions on how to get said keys.

Create local network for jupyter instances (if you have to
docker-compose down and up you do not to redo the network create
step):

 docker network create jupyterhub-network
    
To start server run command:

 docker-compose up

If you do not wish to see debugging information, and wish to run up
docker in the background use:

 docker-compose up -d

Stoping and cleaning up:
------------------------
To stop the server run command:

 docker-compose down

Kill and remove all docker container:

 docker kill $(docker ps -aq)
 docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Or all together:

 docker-compose down; docker kill $(docker ps -aq); docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Remove docker images: 

 docker rmi $(docker images -q)
